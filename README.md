## üí≠ **Why I Built This**

As someone who loves both basketball and coding, I decided to create a fun project combining both passions. By utilizing the **BALLDONTLIE NBA API**, I was able to fetch real player data and incorporate it into the game. This project helped me enhance my React skills while integrating external APIs to bring real-world data into a game.

## üîÆ **Future Ideas**

Although this is a fun side project, I have several ideas for future improvements:

- **Leaderboard**: Track and display your best guesses.
- **Hint System**: Provide players with optional hints for tougher guesses.
- **Detailed Stats**: Show more in-depth player information during the game.
- **Responsive Design**: Enhance mobile experience for a fully responsive game.

## üôè **Acknowledgements**

- **BALLDONTLIE NBA API**: For providing accurate and real-time player data that powers this game.
- **React Icons**: For helping me create an intuitive and engaging UI with beautiful icons.
